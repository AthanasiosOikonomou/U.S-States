# U.S-States

I created this game as side project to learn how to use gui on python.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Consouldenature/U.S-States.git`
2. In the folder 'U.S States Game' you can find all the files needed for this game.

i. main.py is the main code file used for the game.
ii. blank_states_img is the background image we will use for the game.
iii. 50_states is the csv we will use to check if it is a correct guess.

## How to get the game/ code to run

- If you are using windows 11/ visual studio code as me you need first to open the terminal and write the following lines:
    i) python -m venv myenv
    ii) myenv/Scripts/activate
    iii) pip install pandas
  
- You ready to run the code.
  
## Notes
1) To exit the game just write 'exit' as a answer.
2) After you exit the game a new csv file with name 'states_to_learn' will be created with all the states you missed.

## Future Development

- I want to add a new collumn that will count how many times the user missed the states.
